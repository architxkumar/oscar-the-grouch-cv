# Oscar-the-grouch-resume

A fun little Flutter web app showcasing [Oscar the Grouch's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_the_Grouch) CV (if it ever were to exist).

It also accounts for the submission of [Single-Page CV](https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv) Project on [roadmap.sh](https://https://roadmap.sh/).

Just a small, yet cool learning project.

## Features (What I learnt as well)
- 😁 Fun single resume to peek into the life of beloved Oscar
- 📱 Adaptive padding using Flutter's MediaQuery
- 🏗️ Automatic CI/CD via GitHub Actions
